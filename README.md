# My Project Plan (Level 1 Heading)
**Note:** Thise document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide any working guide to an guide to an actual project.

### Proposal (Level 3 Heading)
---------
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objecks in images.
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow]() or [PyTorch](), and other open source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection]:
![image]()

### Dependencies (Level 3 Heading)
- python
- opencv-python
- tensorflow
- openmmlab
- package manager

### Installation
In a bash terminal, run the following commands (*Do NOT actually run these commands in your computer*):
``` sh
$ sudo apt update
$ conda create \-n sv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
$ python \-\-version
$ python example.py
```
